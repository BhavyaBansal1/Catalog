## 📖 Problem Statement

In this assignment, you will work on a simplified version of **Shamir's Secret Sharing** algorithm.

### Polynomial Representation

Consider an unknown polynomial of degree \( m \). To solve for the coefficients, you need \( m + 1 \) roots, represented as \( k = m + 1 \).

An unknown polynomial of degree \( m \) can be represented as:

\[
f(x) = a_m x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + c
\]

Where:
- \( f(x) \) is the polynomial function.
- \( m \) is the degree of the polynomial.
- \( a_m, a_{m-1}, \ldots, a_1, c \) are coefficients (real numbers).
- \( a_m \neq 0 \).

Your task is to find the constant term \( c \) of the polynomial using the given roots, provided in a specific JSON format.

## 📝 Input Format

The input is provided in JSON format, containing polynomial roots that need to be decoded based on their respective bases.

### Sample Test Case

```json
{
    "keys": {
        "n": 4,
        "k": 3
    },
    "1": {
        "base": "10",
        "value": "4"
    },
    "2": {
        "base": "2",
        "value": "111"
    },
    "3": {
        "base": "10",
        "value": "12"
    },
    "6": {
        "base": "4",
        "value": "213"
    }
}
```

### Key Definitions
- **n**: The total number of roots provided.
- **k**: The minimum number of roots required to solve for the coefficients of the polynomial.

---

## 🔍 Constraints

- All coefficients \( a_m, a_{m-1}, \ldots, a_1, c \) are positive integers.
- The coefficients are within the range of a 256-bit number.
- The minimum number of roots \( n \) will always be greater than or equal to \( k \).

---

## 🛠️ Output

Print the secret constant term \( c \) for the given test case.


## 🔑 Checkpoints

1. **Read the Test Case from a Separate JSON File**
   - Parse and read the input provided in JSON format from a separate file.

2. **Decode the Y Values**
   - Decode the Y values that are encoded using different bases.

3. **Find the Secret (C)**
   - Calculate the secret \( c \) using the decoded Y values through any known method (e.g., Lagrange interpolation).
